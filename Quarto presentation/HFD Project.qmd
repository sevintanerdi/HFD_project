## Strategy selection

- *Goal:* robust intraday trend capture with *controlled turnover*
- *Candidates tested:*  
  - EMA crossover (trend-following)  
  - Bollinger bands (mean-reversion)
- *Key observation:*
  - High-frequency mean-reversion signals generated *excessive trading*
  - Transaction costs dominated gross PnL in intraday data
- *Final choice:* *EMA crossover with volatility-scaled entry/exit (hysteresis)*
  - trades only when signals are sufficiently strong
  - significantly reduces noise-driven trades

---
## Key design principle

- The strategy is *not designed to be constantly in the market*
- Positions are opened only when the trend signal is *strong relative to current volatility*
- Small price fluctuations are intentionally ignored
- This design choice:
  - reduces signal noise
  - lowers transaction costs
  - improves net performance stability

## Signal construction

- *Trend direction:* determined by EMA(20) − EMA(240)
  - positive spread → long bias
  - negative spread → short bias

- *Signal strength:* absolute EMA spread normalized by price

- *Volatility scaling:*
  - signal strength is compared to recent realized volatility
  - trades are allowed only when the signal exceeds a volatility-based threshold

## Parameters 

- EMA fast / slow: *20 / 240*
- Volatility window: *120* bars
- Entry / exit multipliers: *k_enter = 10, **k_exit = 5*
- Point value: *50 USD / point*
- Transaction cost: *12 USD per trade*
